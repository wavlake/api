# Wavlake API

A GCP Cloud Run HTTP server that authenticates users via Firebase Auth and Nostr's NIP-98 HTTP auth spec.

## Features

- NIP-98 authentication middleware
- Firebase Auth integration via Firestore
- Nostr track upload and management
- Audio compression with ffmpeg (automatic 128k MP3 + optional custom formats)
- User-controlled compression with multiple formats (MP3, AAC, OGG)
- Compression quality and bitrate controls
- Public/private version management for Nostr publishing
- GCS integration for file storage
- Async processing via Cloud Functions
- Heartbeat endpoint with deployed commit SHA
- Cloud Run deployment ready

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.23+
- Google Cloud SDK
- Firebase project with Firestore enabled

## Local Development

1. Set environment variables:
```bash
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id
export PORT=8080
```

2. Run the server:
```bash
go run cmd/server/main.go
```

## Firestore Setup

Create a `nostr_auth` collection with documents containing:
```json
{
  "pubkey": "hex_encoded_nostr_pubkey",
  "firebase_uid": "firebase_user_id",
  "active": true,
  "created_at": "2025-01-23T12:00:00Z",
  "last_used_at": "2025-01-23T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## Authentication

Requests must include a NIP-98 auth event in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Nostr base64_encoded_event
```

The event must be a kind 27235 event with:
- `u` tag: exact request URL
- `method` tag: HTTP method
- Valid signature
- Timestamp within 60 seconds

## Architecture Overview

### Infrastructure Components

1. **API Service** (Cloud Run)
   - Go backend handling authentication and track management
   - Manages track metadata in Firestore
   - Generates presigned URLs for direct GCS uploads
   - Processes audio files with ffmpeg

2. **Cloud Storage** (GCS)
   - Bucket: `wavlake-audio`
   - Stores original files in `tracks/original/`
   - Stores compressed files in `tracks/compressed/`
   - CORS configured for browser uploads

3. **Cloud Function** (`process-audio-upload`)
   - Triggered by GCS file uploads
   - Calls API webhook when files land in `tracks/original/`

4. **Firestore**
   - Stores user data and NostrTrack metadata
   - Collections: `users`, `nostr_tracks`

### Track Upload and Compression Flow

#### **Basic Upload (Automatic Compression)**
```
1. User Initiates Upload (Web Client)
   â†“
2. Client creates NIP-98 auth event
   â†“
3. POST /v1/tracks/nostr (API)
   - Validates NIP-98 auth
   - Creates NostrTrack in Firestore
   - Returns presigned URL for original file
   â†“
4. Client uploads file directly to GCS
   - Uses presigned URL
   - File lands in tracks/original/{uuid}.mp3
   â†“
5. GCS triggers Cloud Function
   - Detects new file in tracks/original/
   - Calls API webhook automatically
   â†“
6. API processes track automatically
   - Downloads original from GCS
   - Compresses to 128kbps MP3 (default)
   - Uploads to tracks/compressed/
   - Updates compressed_url field
   â†“
7. Client publishes Nostr event
   - Kind 31337 event with track info
   - Uses compressed_url for streaming
```

#### **Advanced Upload (Custom Compression) - Optional**
```
6. User Requests Custom Compression (Web Client) - OPTIONAL
   - POST /v1/tracks/{id}/compress
   - Specifies desired formats, bitrates, quality levels
   - Can request multiple versions (e.g., 128k MP3, 256k AAC, 64k OGG)
   â†“
7. API processes compression requests
   - Downloads original from GCS
   - Uses ffmpeg with user-specified options
   - Uploads each compressed version to tracks/compressed/
   - Updates Firestore with compression metadata
   â†“
8. User Manages Visibility (Web Client) - OPTIONAL
   - PUT /v1/tracks/{id}/compression-visibility
   - Chooses which versions to make public
   - Controls what appears in Nostr events
   â†“
9. Client Gets Public Versions for Nostr - OPTIONAL
   - GET /v1/tracks/{id}/public-versions
   - Returns only user-selected public versions
   â†“
10. Client publishes enhanced Nostr event - OPTIONAL
    - Kind 31337 event with track info
    - Multiple file URLs with different qualities
    - Users can choose optimal version for their bandwidth
```

## Compression Options

### **Automatic Compression (Default)**
Every uploaded track automatically gets compressed to a 128kbps MP3 version. This ensures:
- âœ… **Backwards Compatibility**: Existing client apps continue to work
- âœ… **Fast Streaming**: Optimized for web playback
- âœ… **Universal Support**: MP3 works everywhere
- âœ… **Immediate Availability**: No additional user action required

The `compressed_url` field in track responses always contains this default compressed version.

### **Custom Compression (Optional)**
Advanced users can request additional compression versions with specific parameters:

#### **Supported Formats**
- **MP3**: Universal compatibility, good compression
- **AAC**: Better quality at same bitrate, modern standard
- **OGG**: Open source, excellent compression

#### **Bitrate Options**
- **32-128 kbps**: Low bandwidth, smaller files
- **128-256 kbps**: Balanced quality and size  
- **256-320 kbps**: High quality, larger files

#### **Quality Levels**
- **Low**: Optimized for small file size
- **Medium**: Balanced quality/size (default)
- **High**: Optimized for audio quality

#### **Sample Rates**
- **22050 Hz**: Lower quality, smaller files
- **44100 Hz**: CD quality (default)
- **48000 Hz**: Professional standard
- **96000 Hz**: High-resolution audio

### **Public/Private Versions**
Users can control which compression versions appear in their Nostr events:
- **Private**: Available only to track owner
- **Public**: Included in kind 31337 Nostr events for streaming
- **Default**: The automatic 128k MP3 is always public

This allows users to offer multiple quality options (e.g., 64k for mobile, 256k for desktop) in a single Nostr event.

### **When to Use Each Approach**

#### **Use Automatic Compression When:**
- âœ… Building a simple music app
- âœ… Want immediate track availability
- âœ… Don't need multiple quality options
- âœ… Prioritizing development speed
- âœ… 128kbps MP3 quality is sufficient

#### **Use Custom Compression When:**
- ðŸŽ¯ Need multiple quality options for different devices
- ðŸŽ¯ Want to offer lossless or high-quality versions
- ðŸŽ¯ Targeting audiophiles with high-end equipment
- ðŸŽ¯ Need specific formats (AAC for Apple, OGG for open source)
- ðŸŽ¯ Want to optimize for different bandwidth scenarios
- ðŸŽ¯ Building advanced music distribution features
